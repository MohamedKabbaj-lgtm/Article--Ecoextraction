1. Introduction
Modification 1
Growing environmental awareness and stricter regulations are currently bringing the Mediterranean olive-growing sector into a crucial phase of its development. The agro-industrial processing of fruits generates substantial quantities of organic residues, which pose considerable challenges in terms of disposal and the potential for resource recovery. The olive oil industry is a prime example of this phenomenon. For instance, it has been determined that merely 20% of the fruit's weight is actually transformed into oil, with the residual 80% being converted into what is commonly referred to as olive pomace waste [1]. This semi-solid waste is characterized by an extremely high organic load and significant concentrations of phenolic substances, which pose serious environmental risks [2]. The ecological impact of olive pomace is primarily associated with its content of phytotoxic phenolic compounds, such as oleuropein, hydroxytyrosol, and tyrosol. While these compounds are valued for their antioxidant potential, they contribute to the environmental burden of olive oil by-products due to their persistence and toxicity [3]. Their phytotoxicity is expressed through the inhibition of seed germination and plant growth, as well as the alteration of soil physicochemical properties when olive mill residues are applied to land. These effects are linked to decreased soil pH, increased electrical conductivity, and the accumulation of organic matter, nitrogen, sodium, and potassium, ultimately disturbing nutrient availability and soil microbial balance [4]. These compounds possess significant antioxidant, antimicrobial, and anti-inflammatory properties, making them attractive for various industrial applications [5] Polyphenols derived from olive pomace exhibit significant antioxidative properties, effectively inhibiting lipid oxidation and enhancing the stability of edible oils. Their ability to act as natural radical scavengers positions them as superior alternatives to synthetic antioxidants, mitigating potential health risks associated with synthetic compounds.Modification 2 The inclusion of these bioactive compounds in food systems not only extends product shelf life but also aligns with the growing consumer demand for natural and health-promoting ingredients.

2. Materials and methods 
2.1 Chemicals and Reagents
Sodium chloride, 2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS), 2,2′-azobis(2-methylpropionamidine) dihydrochloride (AAPH), choline chloride (≥99%), urea, sodium carbonate (GPR Rectapur), and 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) were purchased from VWR (France), Ethanol, and the Folin–Ciocalteu reagent was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (France).
2.2. Sample preparation:
Fresh olive pomace (OP) from the “Picholine” and “koroneiki” cultivars was collected during October–November 2024. The samples were obtained from the Alicante region (Spain), supplied by the Universidad de Granada (Spain), and produced using a two-phase centrifugation system. The OP samples were transported to Compiègne, France, in sealed plastic containers and stored at −18 °C to prevent polyphenol degradation. The moisture content of the fresh pomace was determined gravimetrically by drying at 105 °C to constant weight. The Arbequina variety exhibited an average moisture content of 51.22 ± 0.15%, while the Picual variety showed 54.45 ± 0.20% (w/w).
2.3 Conventional solid–liquid extraction (CSLE) :
Aliquots of 20 g of olive pomace (OP) were mixed with 200 mL of ethanol–water solutions of varying concentrations (0, 25, 50, 75, and 100%, v/v) following the procedure described by Da Porto et al. (2015). The mixtures were continuously agitated at room temperature to extract phenolic compounds, as reported by Pinelo et al. (2005). Different extraction times (0, 1, 2, 4, 10, 15, 20, 30, 60, and 120 min) were tested to obtain multiple data points for the kinetic extraction curves. All extractions were performed in triplicate.
